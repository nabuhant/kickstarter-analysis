## Overview of Project

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

## Challenges
* YEAR() function did not provide the correct output since column where the function was being applied had short date type. I tested the function YEAR(TODAY()) on a new sheet an it worked. The difference was that the data type there was general. This issue was resolved by setting the Year column's data type to general.
